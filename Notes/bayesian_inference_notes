# Bayesian Inference

# MCMC is not the same as bayesian inference but it is used in baseian in most real world cases when you do not have an explicit posterior 
# MCMC approximates the posterior distrubution (instractable) if you do not have one
## In bayes we need to decide when the method stops running; do not just use default; and do not use the shortest time; we'll get a better posterior the longer the program has to run - we just can't really wait infinitely
